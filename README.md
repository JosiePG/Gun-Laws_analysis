# Gun-Laws_analysis


# Summary
 Project exploring the effect of gun laws on the rate of murder,number of prisoners and number of robberies within a state in the USA
 
 
 Goal : Explore characteristics that could potentially impact different crime metrics within a state in the USA
 
 # Introduction
 
 In this Notebook, we will conduct expoloratory data analysis by creating a Neural Network model using Tensorflow , Pandas , and Seaborn to find any relationships between having gun laws, and the levels of crime within a community. We will also explore different ways to improve the model to ensure a consistently high accuracy model.
